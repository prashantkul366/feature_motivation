Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) and HSIC for representation similarity.

VENDORED from google-research/google-research/representation_similarity
(Kornblith et al., "Similarity of Neural Network Representations Revisited",
ICML 2019, https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.00414).

`gram_linear`, `gram_rbf`, `center_gram`, `cka`, `feature_space_linear_cka`
are the upstream functions, unmodified.

ADDED LOCALLY (not upstream): `hsic_biased`, the standard biased empirical
HSIC estimator tr(KHLH)/(n-1)^2 (Gretton et al. 2005). We need this because
the source paper we are reproducing reports RAW HSIC, not CKA. Note that
raw HSIC is NOT normalized and NOT comparable across pairs whose features
have different scales -- this is exactly why we standardize features before
computing it, and why CKA (which is HSIC normalized by
sqrt(HSIC(X,X)*HSIC(Y,Y))) is the metric we let carry the argument.

DIRECTIONALITY, since it is easy to get backwards:
    CKA and HSIC are SIMILARITY measures. HIGHER = MORE SIMILAR.
    SVCCA is also a similarity measure.  HIGHER = MORE SIMILAR.
  So for the "representational diversity" reading, LOWER is more diverse
  for all of these. Never report CKA under a "lower is better" arrow
  without saying explicitly that you mean lower similarity.

BANDWIDTH: `gram_rbf` uses the median heuristic computed from the
representation's OWN pairwise squared distances (`threshold` multiplies the
median). This is applied identically and independently to every
representation -- there is no per-pair tuning anywhere in this pipeline.
